# Architecture

This directory is the canonical architecture working set for Atlas.

The numbered documents are authoritative. `rolling-monolith.md` is generated from those documents for portable reading/retrieval and should not be edited independently.

## Current baseline

**v0.6** makes discovery continuously maintain both decision provenance and the living PRD, adds a
single product-closure boundary before engineering design, and requires a mandatory but
non-authoritative HTML projection, on top of v0.5's planning-root and Stage 0–2 control
clarifications.

## Change discipline

For material changes:

1. Read the relevant canonical documents.
2. Treat the proposal as a delta.
3. Evaluate it as `EXPLORATION`, `CANDIDATE`, or `CHANGE`.
4. If accepted, update the modular documents surgically.
5. Record decisions/course corrections where appropriate.
6. Regenerate the rolling monolith and run a consistency audit.

## Validate the rolling monolith

Run `python3 tools/check_architecture.py` from the repository root. The validator
checks that `rolling-monolith.md` exactly matches the numbered canonical
architecture documents in filename order, including whitespace and newlines.
